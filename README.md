# Database Manager Application

Hello !
This desktop application contains login and signup views and supports four basic functions of persistent storage


## General info
	
Version beta released! I finished basic design assumptions which they were: CRUD functions, two databases, one for login/signup, second for employees, modern "Idiot-proof" GUI, remote connection to databases and all in one .jar file. Application still needs improvements like animations, unit tests, and fixes visible in "Remarks". I will provide them in close future. But now feel free to check out my work!


### Technologies

- Java 8
- JavaFX 8
- MySQL 8

#### Setup

Just open DMA.jar file from "out/artifacts/DMA_jar by JRE in version 1.8.0_201  at least


##### Remarks 

- I need to look up for better hosting, because current is free which means very slow connection with database
- Searching for employee after clicking key when entering employee data is delayed by one letter
